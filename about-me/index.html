<p><img src="/img/dan_low.jpg" class="headshot" />I&rsquo;ve spent the past 10 years leading engineering teams at startups and in the public sector. When I&rsquo;m writing code, it&rsquo;s usually infrastructure - reusable terraform modules, CI / CD pipelines, and other things that can help my teams ship product faster and improve our infrastructure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a product focused engineer - I have strong opinions and love talking to users about ways to make products work better for them. While I have spent years working across the stack, these days I do just about anything to avoid writing any CSS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last ~12 years living in Philadelphia, PA. When I&rsquo;m not working, I like to play board games, get outside to run and hike, explore Philly&rsquo;s great restaurant scene.</p>

<p><em>City of Philadelphia, 2019 - present</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past two+ years working in local government as the City of Philadelphia&rsquo;s Director of Software Engineering. During that time, I&rsquo;ve focused on how to bring <strong>cloud-native</strong>, agile practices to City technologies. I&rsquo;ve grown my team threefold and successfully delivered on a number of major projects and initiatives, ranging from launching <a href="https://leadcertification.phila.gov">The Lead and Healthy Homes Site</a>, developing a resident-facing single sign on platform, migrating all of my team&rsquo;s applications into our cloud environments and much more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of my team&rsquo;s work on <strong>equity and access</strong>. Since I&rsquo;ve joined, we&rsquo;ve written citywide policies for web accessibility, made language access (and native translations) a core component of phila.gov and a variety of other applications and more. On top of that, I&rsquo;ve worked with my colleague Sara Hall to build an internal apprenticeship program to improve diversity within our technology positions.</p>
<p>A core focus of the work has been making the applications and sites we support more <strong>reliable and maintainable</strong>. We&rsquo;ve rewritten apps into a standard architecture on AWS Fargate (provisioned by a terraform module), allowing for extremely high uptime across everything we do. We&rsquo;ve written <a href="http://ui.phila.gov">PhilaUI</a> to give us a consistent look and feel across our applications. We&rsquo;ve also invested heavily in reusable patterns in our APIs.</p>

<p><em>Instructure | Practice | ApprenNet, 2014 - 2019</em></p>
<p>I joined an education technology company, ApprenNet, as employee #2, at the start of 2014. As the company grew, I eventually moved into a VP of Engineering role by the time we were acquired by Instructure in 2017. On the way, we built multiple products, closed an enterprise deal with the largest nursing education provider in the country and much more. I led the team through due diligence and acquisition to a new home at Instructure, where I led geographically separate teams working on Canvas and Bridge in Salt Lake City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Chicago.</p>
