      <description>Note: The below is not an official communication of the City of Philadelphia, all opinions are my own
While we can all agree that engineers hate meetings, we all also know that we work better when we&amp;rsquo;re part of a community. Most engineers want to have colleagues that give thoughtful code reviews, want to participate in a collaborative software design process, and feel supported. Nobody likes the feeling of being the only one that can solve an issue - and more practically, being on call all of the time.</description>

      <title>Performance tasks for hiring engineers</title>

      <description>A lot of engineers are staunchly opposed to the idea of a performance / take home task in the hiring process, and I get it. They can be time consuming, they&amp;rsquo;re often scoped incorrectly, and it can be hard to imagine that the hiring team spends anywhere near the amount of time on it that you did. There are also equity issues with take home tasks - not everyone has a huge amount of time to spend working on these.</description>
