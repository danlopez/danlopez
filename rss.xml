      <title>Context Matters</title>

      <description>Over the past 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as an engineering leader at a small startup (&amp;lt; 5 engineers), a mid-sized public company (about 350 engineers), and a local government (about 50 engineers). Whenever I move into a new role, I&amp;rsquo;m always asked to review the systems in place and set out a plan to improve them. My (and most people&amp;rsquo;s) tendency is to heavily pattern match. Your old company&amp;rsquo;s flavor of agile was a rigid scrum model?</description>

      <title>Building Developer Communities</title>

      <description>Note: The below is not an official communication of the City of Philadelphia, all opinions are my own
While we can all agree that engineers hate meetings, we all also know that we work better when we&amp;rsquo;re part of a community. Most engineers want to have colleagues that give thoughtful code reviews, want to participate in a collaborative software design process, and feel supported. Nobody likes the feeling of being the only one that can solve an issue - and more practically, being on call all of the time.</description>

      <title>Performance tasks for hiring engineers</title>

      <description>A lot of engineers are staunchly opposed to the idea of a performance / take home task in the hiring process, and I get it. They can be time consuming, they&amp;rsquo;re often scoped incorrectly, and it can be hard to imagine that the hiring team spends anywhere near the amount of time on it that you did. There are also equity issues with take home tasks - not everyone has a huge amount of time to spend working on these.</description>

      <title>Dynamic DNS</title>

      <description>I knew that hosting a website behind a residential ISP would lead to some interesting new issues. The first of those is handling Dynamic IP addresses. As many of you are likely aware, the IP address that you get from your ISP is likely to change at any time&amp;hellip; a.k.a, is a dynamic ip address.
In my initial plans, I wanted to preserve some flexibility here, so I looked for a domain registrar &amp;amp; dns provider with an API and landed on google domains.</description>

      <description>Edited 10/11 to account for dynamic DNS
This site exists because I happened to have an extra raspberry pi sitting around that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using and thought it would be fun to host a super lightweight, performant site on it. Is this the cheapest way I can do things? No&amp;hellip; because GitHub pages is free. But it&amp;rsquo;s more fun!
After talking to my ISP and confirming that they are ok with it - which was really, really lucky, because most ISPs explicitly don&amp;rsquo;t allow it - I stood things up.</description>
