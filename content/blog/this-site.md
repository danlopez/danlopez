This site exists because I happened to have an extra raspberry pi sitting around that I wasn't using and thought it would be fun to host a super lightweight, performant site using it on my home ISP. However... I learned that doing so violates the terms of service for my internet connection. Considering that I rely on my home internet to actually work, this seemed like a non-starter. A quick google didn't reveal any clear reason *why* this is the case, but I'm assuming it's a legal liability thing. So, I'll leave the original stack description up, but for now, this is just gonna live on GitHub Pages. 

The stack this site is built on: 

* ~raspberry pi 4 running raspbian~
* ~nginx~
* built using hugo & simple.css
* ~deployed on the same raspberry pi using a self-hosted github action~
