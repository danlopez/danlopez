While we can all agree that engineers hate meetings, we all also know that we work better when we're part of a community. Most engineers want to have colleagues that give thoughtful code reviews, want to participate in a collaborative software design process, and feel supported. Nobody likes the feeling of being the only one that can solve an issue - and more practically, being on call all of the time. 

Building developer community in your organization is absolutely critical for high performing organizations. It will improve developer retention and satisfaction, leading to improved performance and reliability of your services. But, it's not easy to build a collaborative community - especially in an organization like the City of Philadelphia.

## How we're constructed

Like other large municipalities (and, I'm assuming, state and federal governments, some large enterprises, and more), the City is an extremely silo'ed environment. We have over 50 departments within the administration, not to mention a handful of separate row offices like our City Commissioners (our term for board of elections), DA's office, Sheriff's office, City Council and more. Each of these departments historically ran their own IT organizations. A number of years before I landed at the City many of the large departments were "consolidated" and created a matrix structure within the central Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT). Many other departments remain fully silo'ed. 

I lead OIT's software engineering organization, a group of 10-15 developers working on projects ranging from phila.gov to the LHHP database to shared services like PhilaUI. We take on projects with departments, we consult with departments on their own projects both from vendors and developed internally, we review and consult on RFPs and much more. 

At least 10 departments also have their own dev teams, ranging from large teams at some of the largest departments to a lone developer elsewhere. We've attempted to build a community here to bring all of our developers together - but the environment certainly presents some unique challenges. 


## Three tiers of developer community

While our goal is for all developers at the City to feel supported in their mission to produce high quality code and reliable, accessible services for City developers, not everyone is interested and willing to engage. 

### Tier 1: Visibility & standards
The lowest level of community starts with visibility. At central OIT, we want to make sure we know what everyone is building, where their source code lives (ideally in our central GitHub), where their services reside online and whether they are up. We also want to help developers build software that's more secure and better supported when things go wrong. If a department with a single developer loses them and we *don't* know where the source lives, that can present a huge problem. 

This tier is also characterized by standards. At OIT's software team, we work with our Enterprise Architecture team and others in leadership to write and disseminate standards for other developers to follow. These range from accessibility (our a11y strategy is built on WCAG 2.1 AA) to observability and documentation. Our lowest 'tier' of community is the departments that need to be in compliance with standards. Even building awareness of these standards can be a challenge, so we start there - and then we do our best to provide support to developers as they implement these. 

### Tier 2: Shared Services and a "paved path"
The next tier of community we see at the City is developers that share patterns and services. OIT software has worked with departments to develop shared Terraform modules to provision scalable, secure APIs in our cloud environments. We've built a UIKit (PhilaUI) that departments can use to provide accessible, standards compliant interfaces. We have centralized management of monitoring and alerting. We're going to be launching a resident-facing SSO platform to make auth easier to build (and more secure).

We try to work with departments to provide on ramps to using these services. In some cases, it's as simple as opening a ticket. We try (although don't always succeed) to be relentlessly positive and provide developers to pair on these initiatives. 

This approach is generally characterized by the "paved road" approach popularized by Netflix. While we don't mandate using our shared services, we want to make it easiest to achieve our standards by doing so. Teams are free to implement their own solutions as well. 

### Tier 3: Consistent vision and practices
When teams choose to embrace all of our shared services, whether by embedding their developers with us, partnering with us to develop services, or leaning in on their own, we get to our top tier of community. We're using shared tooling, we build apps the same way, we document them in the same places and more. 

When we're at this level, it's easier to provide support and grow together - it's almost like a superpower. We can share code samples, we can debug each other's services and more. While we don't need to bring all departments and groups here to be successful, we think that doing so helps the City deliver higher quality services more efficiently.

### Shared Services

### Exchange of Ideas (DevXChange)

### Transparency


5. What we need?
    1. More time to engage. More support from departmental leadership. More educational opportunities.
