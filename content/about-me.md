I’m an engineering leader with a focus on building world-class engineering teams, both in the public and private sectors. I’m currently working as the Director of Software Engineering at the City of Philadelphia, leading our teams working on a variety of projects to serve Philadelphia’s residents and employees. Previously, my work was in the startup world - most recently at Practice, where I led our engineering teams through our acquisition by Instructure in 2019.

For the past 12 years, I’ve lived in Philadelphia, PA, where I spend too much time exploring our incredible food scene. When I’m not working / eating / drinking, I’m usually spending my time running on the Schuylkill River Trail or playing board games (current favorites are Wingspan & Gloomhaven).
