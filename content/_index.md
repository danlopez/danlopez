### Building resilient systems & great products

<img src="/img/dan.jpeg" class="headshot" alt="Photo of Dan Lopez" />I’ve spent my career building inclusive, impactful digital solutions. With a deep background in engineering leadership, product development, digital accessibility, and responsible AI, I’m passionate about creating technology that empowers people and transforms organizations. I've led technical organizations in the federal government, where I served as the Director of [login.gov](https://login.gov/), in local government and at a number of startups. I care deeply about doing work with a strong mission behind it that leads to positive impact for our society. [Learn more about me and my work]({{< relref "/about-me" >}} "About Me")
